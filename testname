If neither base case holds, a recursive lookup is 
done on the appropriate subtree. Since all values less than 
the root's value are in the left subtree and all values greater 
than the root's value are in the right subtree, there is no point 
in looking in both subtrees: if the value we're looking for is less 
than the value in the root, it can only be in the left subtree 
(and if it is greater than the value in the root, it can only be in the right subtree).
